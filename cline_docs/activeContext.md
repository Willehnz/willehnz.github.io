# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing Firebase initialization and loading sequence

## Recent Changes
1. Firebase Loading:
   - Added SDK loading check
   - Improved initialization sequence
   - Added loading timeouts
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Better loading feedback

2. Script Loading:
   - Fixed script loading order
   - Added loading state checks
   - Improved dependency management
   - Added initialization logging
   - Enhanced error recovery

3. Initialization Flow:
   - Proper Firebase SDK check
   - Database initialization verification
   - Module loading sequence
   - State verification steps
   - Error boundary handling

## Current State
Improved initialization implementation:

1. Loading Sequence:
   - Firebase SDK loading check
   - Database initialization wait
   - Module pre-loading
   - Theme initialization
   - Admin panel setup

2. Error Management:
   - Loading timeouts
   - SDK verification
   - Initialization checks
   - Error recovery
   - User feedback

3. State Management:
   - Loading state tracking
   - Initialization verification
   - Dependency checks
   - Error boundaries
   - Recovery paths

## Key Improvements
1. Reliability:
   - Proper SDK loading check
   - Better initialization sequence
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Loading state verification
   - Recovery mechanisms

2. Performance:
   - Optimized loading order
   - Parallel module loading
   - Reduced initialization time
   - Better resource management
   - Loading feedback

3. User Experience:
   - Clear loading states
   - Better error messages
   - Graceful degradation
   - Loading feedback
   - Recovery options

## Next Steps
1. Testing:
   - Verify loading sequence
   - Test error handling
   - Check recovery paths
   - Monitor performance
   - Validate user feedback

2. Monitoring:
   - Track loading times
   - Monitor initialization
   - Check error rates
   - Measure performance
   - Analyze user impact

## Notes
- Firebase loading improved
- Initialization sequence fixed
- Error handling enhanced
- Loading feedback added
- Recovery mechanisms implemented
