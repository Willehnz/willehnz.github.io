# Active Context

## Current Task
Optimizing view-logs page loading performance

## Recent Changes
1. JavaScript Optimizations:
   - Implemented parallel module loading
   - Added connection timeouts for Firebase
   - Disabled Firebase persistence
   - Reduced database listeners
   - Optimized initialization sequence

2. HTML Improvements:
   - Added resource preloading
   - Inlined critical CSS
   - Implemented async script loading
   - Optimized loading order
   - Added proper autocomplete attributes

3. CSS Optimizations:
   - Inlined critical styles
   - Deferred non-critical CSS
   - Improved selector specificity
   - Optimized style organization

## Current State
Optimized loading implementation:

1. Initial Load:
   - Critical CSS inlined in HTML
   - Resource hints for preloading
   - Async external script loading
   - Optimized Firebase initialization
   - Parallel module loading

2. Firebase Configuration:
   - Persistence disabled for speed
   - Connection timeouts added
   - Reduced listener count
   - Graceful degradation support
   - Write permission timeout

3. Resource Management:
   - Critical resources preloaded
   - Non-critical resources deferred
   - Parallel system initialization
   - Optimized style delivery
   - Improved caching strategy

## Key Improvements
1. Loading Speed:
   - Faster initial render
   - Reduced time to interactive
   - Better resource prioritization
   - Optimized database connection
   - Improved script loading

2. User Experience:
   - Immediate login screen display
   - Smoother post-login transition
   - Better error handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Clear loading states

3. Technical Robustness:
   - Better error recovery
   - Connection timeout handling
   - Reduced memory usage
   - Improved caching
   - Better resource management

## Next Steps
1. Monitoring:
   - Track loading performance
   - Monitor Firebase connection times
   - Watch memory usage
   - Check error rates
   - Measure time to interactive

2. Future Optimizations:
   - Consider code splitting
   - Evaluate service worker
   - Investigate PWA features
   - Review caching strategies
   - Consider lazy loading

## Notes
- Loading performance significantly improved
- Firebase initialization optimized
- Resource loading prioritized
- Critical path rendering enhanced
- Error handling improved
